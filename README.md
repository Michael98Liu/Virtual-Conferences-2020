# Virtual Conferences and Seminars 2020

While COVID-19 has caused suffering and affliction worldwide, one benefit, although in no way could offset the damage caused by the pandemic, is that the sharing of academic resources is more democratized. Conferences and seminars have mostly gone virtual, granting access of knowledge to people all around world. This repository serves as a reminder to myself of all the academic resources that I can make use of, but also creates a space for people to curate and publicize information on virtual conferences and seminars.
